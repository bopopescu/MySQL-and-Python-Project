Report 1:
Ive basically just been watching different videos regarding connecting python and mysql together and
doing small exercises i found on the internet.

Then i started planning how im gonna split the task up into different sections and then join them together
The plan for tonight is to setup my CLI in python for the main menu then i'll be setting up the
different tables needed in mysql.

At the moment im happy with the slow approach ive taken towards the task. It will help me better
down the line since ive made everything i need and want clear to myself.

Report 2:
So today i decided to lay out my mysql structure. I decided to go with 3 tables for now, that would
be users, students login/out and staff login/out. I chose to seperate students and lecturer tables
inorder to make it easier to see who is in what category... Then im thinking my forth table will
be to see who is logged in on the premises at the moment incase of emergies or for general 
statistical purposes.

So now im ready to handle my python section of my four splits. I already have a plan for the layout
of my menu which i'll start later tonight or from tomorrow.

Report 3:
Got quite a bit done over the weekend. If i had to say, im 80-85% done with my project, i just want
to make the cli look nicer now and then i want to change the way i assign an ID to a user. Other 
than that im nearly there!

Report 4:
Spent my day changing my primary keys from email and username to just user_id and added line skips
and special characters like _ and = to decorate code. Will be submitting my code soon.
